;;;; GNU GPL license applies.
;;;;
;;;; CCGlab implements all universal rules of CCG, covering all directional variants of 
;;;;     combination: application, composition, substitution, subcomposition, powers of B, S and O, 
;;;;     namely B, B^2, B^3 and S^2, and O^2. Type-raising can be implemented as a lexical rule, which 
;;;;     is provided as a mechanism. Meta-categories e.g. those in (X\X)/X of coordination, are assumed to be
;;;;     lexically headed, and allow for application only (because there is no unification, and
;;;;     we make maximal computational use of CCG's procedural neutrality, by which any two adjacent category
;;;;     can only combine one way, if we avoid meta-unifiable cats.)
;;;;
;;;; It also implements probabilistic CCG's (PCCG) parsing function, which finds the most likely LF for a string, 
;;;;     given the lexicon and its parameters.
;;;;
;;;; - It has four components:
;;;;     1) a transformer to turn paper-style CCG categories to lisp objects,
;;;;     2) a deductive component to CKY-parse a string, 
;;;;     3) an inductive component for PCCG for parse ranking.
;;;;     4) A modeling component to help set your parameters for the inductive component.
;;;; - It represents offline grammars serially, as lisp lists, and parse objects as hashtables, for speed.
;;;; - It can handle Steedman-style lexical type assignments, and lexical rules.
;;;; - CCGlab uses only one Lisp tool: LALR parser of Mark Johnson. Thanks for that.
;;;;     The locally used copy is provided as an external file. The rest is standard Common Lisp.
;;;; - Since you asked after seeing the LALR component, CCGlab is a non-deterministic parser.
;;;;     The LALR subcomponent is used to parse text descriptions of lexical items and rules to Lisp structures,
;;;;     which is deterministic (and probably not SLR, so thanks to MJ again.)
;;;; - The fourth component of course cannot be automated like the others. It depends on the modeler. It is
;;;;     there as a facility; if you get your training right, the third component will give
;;;;     you parameter estimation, most likely LF for a string.
;;;; - All we can say about parameters of the fourth component is that, minimally they will contain lexical entries,
;;;;   i.e. lexical features, because that is what is scalar-multiplied as parameters during the CKY parse.
;;;;   If you have more parameters, you'd know how to train for them. A Plug-in is provided.
;;;; - CCGlab-manual.pdf describes the data and file structures, and gives some examples.

;;;; =============================================================================

;;;; CRITICAL NOTES ABOUT CCG's lambda forms and CL lambda forms:
;;;
;;;; 1) We assume the input functions are curried.
;;;; 2) CL does not like to re-define constants, hence defining LF constants as Lisp
;;;;  constants wouldn't work since it's very likely that they overlap in your lexicon. 
;;;;  (quote sleep) wouldn't work either because it only
;;;;  delays evaluation of sleep by one step, for quote itself is a function. 
;;;;  Therefore since we have many LF constants with overlapping names, we use !c to
;;;;  fake a constant c, which is actually a function that returns c as a string constant.
;;;;  Use !c in LFs wherever you need a true constant (i.e. something that evaluates to itself ALL THE TIME).
;;;; 3) PCCG component of CCGlab requires checking for LF equivalence. This is almost impossible if we
;;;;  use native lambdas of Lisp, because internal reductions will be saved by Lisp in a different format 
;;;;  (closures, functions) which we cannot penetrate. If your input sentence does not lead to an LF
;;;;  with no lambdas, the leftover lambdas would be invisible, and we cannot check for equality.
;;;;  So we implement our own lambda language, and use that for combinators and in translating your input.

;;;;  We translate all combinator instructions to lambda terms in our lambda ADT language
;;;;  so that LF normalizer only works with our lambdas.
